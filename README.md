# Switcheroo Lite

![Organized demo](/dev/albums.jpg)

A fork of [nxshot](https://github.com/s1cp/nxshot) that has some improved internals and support for nswdb's titleid format.

> _**NOTE:** As of [version 11.0.0](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/43314#v1100), you do not necessarily need to use this program as Nintendo does this automatically when [connecting your switch to a computer](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/53664) via `System Settings > Data Management > Manage Screenshots and Videos > Copy to a Computer via USB Connection`_

## Usage

This can also be obtained by running the python script with the `--help` flag

```text
usage: switcheroo_lite.py [-h] [--version] [-u] [-r] [--overwrite] [--no-videos] [--no-screenshots] [-q] ALBUMPATH

Automatically organize and timestamp your Nintendo Switch screenshots and clips

positional arguments:
  ALBUMPATH             'Nintendo/Album' folder from your SD card.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -u, --update-cache    Update cached games list via online database. Requires key.txt to be present
  -r, --include-regions
                        Include game region - USA, JPN, etc. - in the folder name
  --overwrite           Overwrite file if it already exists
  --no-videos           Do not organize video (.mp4) files
  --no-screenshots      Do not organize image (.jpg) files
  -q, --quiet           Don't print standard out to console
  ```

## How to Use

- Download the repository as a [zip file](https://github.com/dmynerd78/switcheroo-lite/archive/master.zip)
- Download/Ensure [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed - make sure `export to PATH` is enabled
- Install required libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Extract zip folder and run the script via command line `python switcheroo_lite.py [path/to/Nintendo/Album/]`

## Use of `key.txt`

`key.txt` holds a hard coded key which is stored within the Nintendo Switch. It's used for programatically decrypting online titleIDs into screenshot IDs. It's possible to use this program without it - you just can't run `--update-cache`

## How to update game IDs cache without `key.txt`

Open up `gameids.json` in Notepad++ or an equivalent program (regular Notepad not recommended). In "progammer terms" this uses the [JSON file format](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) where each screenshot id maps to a game name. Format is as follows:

```json
"SCREENSHOT_ID": "GAME_NAME",
```

Essentially, you want to add the game as a new line in between the two curly brackets. To do this, take the garbled text at the end of a screenshot/video as the first quoted value; the game name is the second value.  

For example, say we had the image `2017030311400900-F1C11A22FAEE3B82F21B330E1B786A39.jpg` that was taken in `The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild`. We would get `F1C11A22FAEE3B82F21B330E1B786A39` from the end of the filename to be our screenshot id. If `gameids.json` already has this screenshot id, you can simply update the game name that follows `F1C11A22FAEE3B82F21B330E1B786A39`. If `gameids.json` does not contain the screenshot id, then we would then add the following line to our `gameids.json` file like so:

```json
"F1C11A22FAEE3B82F21B330E1B786A39": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild",
```

The double quotes around the items and the comma at the end of the line are required.  
> _**Note:** the program will remove any invalid characters (colon, question mark, etc.) from the folder name automatically_
